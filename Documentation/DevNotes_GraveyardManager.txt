TODO:
	Figure out exactly how I'm going to setup this DB

Work done before any releases

	Working on the webpage, integrating some models, cannot fully integrate because VS crashes as I launch the NuGet package manager to add the Entity Framework to the project
	Actually was able to install the framework from the NuGet command line tool
09-25-2018
	Worked on webpage
	Finished the TableEntry class, moved the SqlHelper and the TableEntry classes to the GraveyardCommon DLL instead of the Utility DLL
	Table Creation is complete, need to populate now based on the Plot and Person objects, may need to come up with a good solution for that, possibly a ToString() override depicting an SQL 
	record entry
09-24-2018
	There is some shared functionality that is going to be integrated between the webserver and the application, I have moved relevant classes to a shared library
	New CSProj: GraveyardCommon
	Added Utility.SqlHelper.DoesTableExist()
	Created the MVC webpage page project, setup with Windows Authentication, titled project: GraveyardManagerWebpage
	Moved the sql initialization code to a separate thread called whenever UC_Display is used
	Added the Util.TableEntry class which describes an entry in a table for initialization
09-23-2018
	Started working with the database, can access the DB, connection is semi functional, Utility DLL now has an SqlHelper public static class to support interacting with the DB in 
	some different ways
09-22-2018
	Created the ability for the user to load a cleansed file into the DB_Storage public static class
Created on 09-22-2018, previously I had a lot done to this program that I'm going to leave undocumented right now
